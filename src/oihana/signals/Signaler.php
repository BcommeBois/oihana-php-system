/**
 * Contract for objects that communicate through signal/slot patterns.
 *
 * This interface defines the core API for event-driven communication systems
 * where objects can emit signals and connect receivers to handle those signals.
 * It provides a decoupled, flexible way to implement the observer pattern with
 * priority-based execution and lifecycle management.
 *
 * Implementing classes should provide:
 * - Registration and removal of receivers (observers/listeners)
 * - Signal emission to notify all connected receivers
 * - Priority-based execution ordering
 * - Auto-disconnect capability for one-time listeners
 * - Thread-safe receiver management (if applicable)
 *
 * Use cases:
 * - Event systems (user interactions, system events)
 * - Plugin architectures (extensibility points)
 * - State change notifications (model updates)
 * - Command pattern implementations
 * - Message buses and pub/sub systems
 *
 * @example Basic implementation usage
 * ```php
 * // Any class implementing Signaler can be used polymorphically
 * function setupEventHandlers( Signaler $signal ): void
 * {
 *     $signal->connect( fn($data) => logEvent($data), priority: 10 );
 *     $signal->connect( fn($data) => sendNotification($data) );
 *
 *     if ( $signal->connected() ) {
 *         $signal->emit( 'Event data' );
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * $mySignal = new Signal();
 * setupEventHandlers( $mySignal );
 * ```
