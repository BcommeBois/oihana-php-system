/**
 * Provides a centralized lifecycle around model calls for controllers.
 *
 * This trait defines two extensibility hooks — {@see beforeModelCall()} and
 * {@see afterModelCall()} — that are automatically invoked around every
 * primary model operation (such as `list`, `get`, `last`, `count`,
 * `insert`, `update`, `replace`, `delete`).
 *
 * It allows controllers to:
 * - Inject request-scoped context into model calls (e.g. user, locale, filters).
 * - Normalize or enrich the `$init` payload before it reaches the model.
 * - Inspect, transform, or decorate the model result in a single place.
 * - Implement cross-cutting concerns such as logging, auditing, caching,
 *   access control, or data post-processing.
 *
 * Both hooks operate on the `$init` payload (and for the "after" hook, the
 * `$result`) **by reference**, allowing in-place mutation without duplicating
 * logic across controller actions.
 *
 * Typical lifecycle:
 *
 * ```text
 * Controller action
 *     ↓
 * beforeModelCall($request, $init)
 *     ↓
 * $result = $this->model->operation($init)
 *     ↓
 * afterModelCall($request, $init, $result)
 *     ↓
 * Response handling
 * ```
 *
 * This design helps keep controllers thin and avoids duplicating logic across
 * multiple HTTP methods by centralizing model interaction concerns.
 *
 * @internal This trait is intended to be used by base controllers such as
 *           `DocumentsController` and extended in concrete controllers.
 *
 * @see beforeModelCall()
 * @see afterModelCall()
